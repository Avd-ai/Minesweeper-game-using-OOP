# Minesweeper-game-using-OOP

Developed a well-known minesweeper game by applying Object oriented programming concepts

1) Used Tkinter library for UI components
2) Divided the code in multiple files :
   a) project.py - The main file, that specifies the UI design and imports code from other files.
   b) cell.py - maintains the data for each cell in the grid. This also handles button interactions and drives the game logic until the final result.
   c) mysettings.py - The modifiable setting features, such as size of the window, grid_size etc.
   d) utilities.py - to perform simple functions, such as calculate percentage etc
3) The cell buttons become inactive afte the game is over.
4) Some features may not work based on Mac vs windows etc
5) Future scope : Take grid size from the user.
                : 'restart the game' option.

Run the project.py file in a way similar to 'python project.py' from terminal
